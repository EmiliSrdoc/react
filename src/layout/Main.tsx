      <h2>Here are some very cute cats</h2>
      <h3>And one very short story, it goes like this...</h3>
      <p>
        One day my dogs woke up, drank water, went for a walk and saw 1, 2, 3,
        4, 5... 13 cats. it was a big drama.

        they said woof woof, tough they were scared, I said “look how cute they
        are,” but inside the cats were pure evil. We took them to our home and
        gave one of them a name. It was Gerry. Next was Alex and so on... The
        next day (Wednesday) I went to a building, there is an office where I
        work.

        I worked until 1 AM, then went to buy food for the cats. When I came
        home. The cats made a hole mess, they pushed a glass from the table,
        pooped on the floor and played whit my diary. I was not quite happy, but
        I thought that they did it by accident. The next day it was the same,
        all broken. It was enough.
