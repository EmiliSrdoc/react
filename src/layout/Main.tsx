      <p>
        One day my dogs woke up, drank water, went for a walk and saw 1, 2, 3,
        4, 5... 13 cats. it was a big drama.

        they said woof woof, thow they were scared, I said “look how cute they
        are,” but inside the cats were pure evell. We took them to our home and
        gave one of them a name. It was Gerry. Next was Alex and so on... The
        next day (wednesday) I went to a building, there is an office where I
        work
